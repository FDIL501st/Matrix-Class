#FDIL's thoughts

Currently am thinking of the matrix class being similar to <vectors> or <strings> in C++, in the sense how they allocate an array of pointers in heap, 
each pointer in that array points to an array in heap.

Another idea I had was instead of arrays with all the numbers, I have a linked list. This helps with potentialy memory issues of lacking heap for very large matrixes.
However issue is the speed of accessing each element.

For now will point to arrays as for the most part, I believe the memory issues of lacking consecutive bytes in heap shouldn't be an issue as I don't see much use case for 1000 doubles for example.
